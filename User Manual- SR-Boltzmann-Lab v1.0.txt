📝 Overview

This tool automates the calculation of Boltzmann-weighted average specific rotation [α]D​ from multiple Gaussian output files. It is designed for natural product chemistry research, specifically for assigning absolute configurations.
⚙️ Computational Physics (Fixed Constants)

To ensure reproducibility in scientific publications, the following constants are hard-coded into the engine:

    Temperature (T): 298.15 K (25.0 °C)

    Gas Constant (R): 0.001987204 kcal/(mol·K)

    Energy Conversion: 627.5095 kcal/mol per Hartree

🚀 How to Use
1. Prepare Gaussian Logs

Ensure your Gaussian calculations (typically using L914) are completed with Normal termination. The app requires both the Gibbs Free Energy and the Specific Rotation value from each log file.
2. Drag & Drop

Simply drag and drop your .log or .out files into the "Step 1: Drop Gaussian Log Files" area. You can upload any number of conformers simultaneously.

    Note: If no files are uploaded, the calculation results remain grayed out.

3. Review Results

The app automatically parses the files and generates a data table including:

    Relative Energy (ΔG): Calculated relative to the most stable conformer.

    Population (%): The Boltzmann distribution of each conformer.

    Contribution: The weighted specific rotation for each entry.

4. Export for Supporting Information (SI)

    Final [α]D​: The Boltzmann-averaged value is displayed prominently at the bottom.
